# ventura-county-coronavirus-outbreaks-businesses

This repo records coronavirus outbreaks at Ventura County businesses reported by the county public health department.

Data are scraped from the [county's map](https://www.venturacountyrecovers.org/business-outbreaks/) of outbreaks at retail stores, restaurants and other workplaces. An outbreak, according to [state standards](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Workplace-Outbreak-Employer-Guidance.aspx), is defined as three or more cases of COVID-19.

Here's the county's description:
>#### Ventura County Non-Residential Settings With Reported Outbreaks Since January 1, 2021 (including workplaces, food, and retail stores)
>
>This data is dynamic and may not reflect real-time investigation information as this map is only updated once per week on Fridays. Non-Residential settings include workplaces, food and retail stores, and places of worship. This list of businesses within our county, reflects a composite view of those businesses which have identified an outbreak as defined by state and federal criteria and have worked with Ventura County Public Health (VCPH) in mitigating the Covid-19 virus within their facility. The placement of a business on this list is not necessarily indicative of a current or ongoing outbreak. Inclusion on this list does not suggest neglect or wrongdoing on the part of the facility. Each facility is working with VCPH and taking all of the recommended steps to ensure a safe work place.

Data are uploaded in each week as a [CSV](https://github.com/seangreene/ventura-county-coronavirus-outbreaks-businesses/tree/main/_data/csv).
